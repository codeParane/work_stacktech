DI one of the Design pattern used in angular to allow components, services to receive the depedencies as a injection 
instead of creating in each classes. 

using this approach we can reduce the coupling between classes. also angular provide 3 level injection
root: available by application level
module: available to all the components inside module
component: availble only that component.
